> How well do you know your DEADFACE hackers? Test your trivia knowledge of our beloved friends at our favorite hactivist collective! Weâ€™ll start with bumpyhassan. Even though he grates on TheZeal0t a bit, we find him to be absolutely ADORKABLE!!!

> Choose one of the binaries below to test your BH trivia knowledge.

> Enter the flag in the format: flag{Ch33ri0z_R_his_FAV}.

You are given a binary file.

## Solution

Run the binary to see what it does:

</p>

Using `strings` on the binary we find an interesting string of text 
`I&_9a%mx_tRmE4D3DmYw_9fbo6rd_aFcRbE,D.D>Y[!]!'!q`

I tried using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) magic but got nothing. Looked at the code in [dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/) and found that the flag is shifted. We can take the ciphertext we found and remove every other letter to get the flag.

## Flag

**`flag{I_am_REDDY_for_FREDDY!!!}`**

## Tools

- **`strings`**
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- [dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/)
