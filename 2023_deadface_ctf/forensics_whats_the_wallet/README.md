> Ransomware was recently discovered on a system within De Monneâ€™s network courtesy of a DEADFACE member. Luckily, they were able to restore from backups. You have been tasked with finding the Bitcoin wallet address from the provided sample so that it can be reported to the authorities. Locate the wallet address in the code sample and submit the flag as flag{wallet_address}.

You are given a text file.

```

## Solution

Download the attached txt file and search for the wallet address. It is base64 encoded. 

Decode from base64 using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to get the flag.

## Flag

**`flag{n33ha5nozixe6rrg71kgwyinmkusx2}`**
