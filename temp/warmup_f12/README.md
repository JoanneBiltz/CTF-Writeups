## Solution

You start the instance and click on the url to start the challenge. It is a button that gives you the flag. It flashes in a popup box so quickly that you can't see it.

Looking at the source code you find a reference to `/capture_the_flag.html`

  <img height=300 img src=./readme_assets/html.PNG/>
</p>

Copy that into the url and you are at another page with a green button that doesn't seem to do anything.

Look at the source code to find the flag.
