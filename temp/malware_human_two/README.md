## Solution

The download is huge and contains MANY files with a hash name.

</p>

There are only write and execute permissions on the files so you can't `cat` anything. Tried giving read permission but still can't `cat`.

Using `diff` on a few files shows one line that is different for each file,
`if (!String.Equals(pass, "978c61df-8806-4ce1-a25a-60290af8265c"))`, with the value being different for each one.

Used `grep` on all files to look at those particular lines and just din't see anything "odd".

I was at a stand still so I re-downloaded the zip file and tried again. This time I get one line that is much longer than the rest.

`666c6167-7b36-6365-3666-366131356464"+"64623065-6262-3333-3262-666166326230"+"62383564-317d-0000-0000-000000000000"`
