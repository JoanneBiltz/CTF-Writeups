## Solution

I was able to unzip the file with `7zip` without doing anything to the file extension.

The unzipped file does not have an extension. Use `file` to see it's a text file. Change the extension to `.txt` and open the text file to get the flag.

## Flag

**`flag{196a71490b7b55c42bf443274f9ff42b}`**

## Tools

- `file`
