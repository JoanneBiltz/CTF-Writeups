## Solution

Download the challenge file and see it has no extension. Use `file` and see it is a `UHarc archive data` file.

Found [UHARC extractor](https://softfamous.com/postdownload-file/uharc-gui/24440/9857/) software and extracted the file. It has an extension of `.ps1`.

`.ps1` stands for `list powershell commands` and can be read with a text editor.

I struggled with de-obfuscating this code for hours. I finally stumbled onto a [video](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance) from John Hammond talking about this exact malware and he walks through how to do it using Remnux.

I downloaded the remnux iso and followed along step by step and now have the encoded flag.

`flag=%66%6c%61%67%7b%64%62%66%65%35%66%37%35%35%61%38%39%38%63%65%35%66%32%30%38%38%62%30%38%39%32%38%35%30%62%66%37%7d`

Decode from hex to get the flag.
