## Solution

I saw on the CTF Discord to use TRI.AG and/or Procman. Tried Triage but don't really know how to use it. Searched through the report but found nothing useful.

Changed tactics. Extracted snake_eater.pyc using [pyinstxtractor](https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/) Now I have to decompile using pycdc.

In the end I just had to look the file up at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) for the flag.
