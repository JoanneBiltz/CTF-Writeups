## Solution

The link takes you to a street view of a building that you have to pinpoint. You can see construction is being done to the building.

</p>

I can't see much else in the street scene that looks like it could be a clue.

I googled the construction company and they have locations in almost 10 cities.

I notice the streetview picture has Google 2019 on it so we are looking for a building that was worked on in 2019.

The comapny website has press releases for their projects so I looked at the 2019 blogs.
https://www.brasfieldgorrie.com/2019/. Nothing really looks like the building but I'm checking the addresses just in case.

Did an image search on the building and it is the Georgia Tech Library.
