## Task analysis

Solve the riddle and code using Leet.

## Enumeration

I googled the riddle given in the challenge description and came up with **`your name`** as the answer. I tried every variation I could think of in the Leet Tranlator but nothing was correct.

I took a closer look at the challenge description and noticed **`poctf{uwsp_ _ _ }`** has three underscores in the flag. I assume this means the answer has three words, not two.

The challenge title makes me think of braille. I googled **`Sight Without Vision`** and found that this is a quote from Helen Keller. I find her full name, **`Helen Adams Keller`**, and try all variations in the Leet Translator. Still no flag. 
## Solution

I spent hours on this challenge going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole. In the end, I tried the challenge title converted to Leet. ***There*** was the flag. I was ***WAY*** overthinking this one.
